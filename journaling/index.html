          WHAT IS BULLET JOURNALING?
          </h3>
          <p2>
          Bullet journaling is a customizable way to organize your life and make it more managable. Some bullet journals are very focused on planning and efficiency, while others are artsy and fun. Any which way, a bullet journal is meant to be a planner that you can do whatever you want with!

          Above are three options that many expirenced  folks use!

          </pbook>
          <p1a>
          <br>
          The journal(left) known as the Leuchtturm 1917
          is considered a top choice by most.
          You can purchase it for $20 on amazon
          but there are cheaper options shown here too.
          Many people like this journal because of
          the many perks, like thick, dotted and
          numbered pages, label stickers, and
          many colors to choose from!
          <br>
          </p1a>
          <p1b>
          <br>
          The journal(middle) is called the Moleskine Dotted Hardcover journal.
          Many people consider this journal to be well made and very customizable.
          You can purchase it for $18 on amazon
          so slightly cheaper than the Leuchtturm.
          This journal is a pretty blank slate, making it well liked among the artsy type for journaling.
          The pages are thick, making them perfect for pens and markers.
          The artist in you will really love this!
          <br>
          </p1b>
          <p1c>
          <br>
          The journal(right) is called the Ghost Grid Dot journal.
          This journal isn't very popular due to the loud cover art, but it's a great place to start for beginners.
          You can purchase it for $10 on amazon making it quite affordable.
          This is yet another perk for beginners.
          This journal is spiral bound, which is not usual for bullet journalling, however many people are more comfortable and familiar with spiral notebooks.
          The pages are thick, dotted, and it has built in index pages at the front.
